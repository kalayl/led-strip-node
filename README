A small test to make node drive a 32-led rgb strip as seen here:
http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/strip-ledm-addressable-p-706.html

Code mostly translated from this example:
http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LED/LED_Strip_Example.pde


Update:
Difficulty driving the led array with only the first led lighting up.
This:

suggests that powering the raspberry from usb is a surefire way of nuking it.
Basically the LED's draw more power than the usb port can pump through.
